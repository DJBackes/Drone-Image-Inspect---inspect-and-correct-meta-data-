## What is this about?
This code provides functions to read, query and manipulate drone image meta data in exif and xmp headers.

## Problem Scenario
![Alt text](DJI-Image1.png?raw=true "Optional Title")<br>
The above image shows that in some cases the gimbals during the image collection get flipped. We are providing a solution for this problem here.
